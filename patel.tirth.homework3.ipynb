    "\n",
    "1. Import the random module\n",
    "2. Define a dictionary.\n",
    "3. Take the user input for the name of the file and open it in the read mode.\n",
    "4. Run a for loop to seperate the words in the sentences of the file by storing them in a variable 'word' and further store them in the dictionary.\n",
    "5. Ask the user in order to start the program or to exit the program by asking to answer in the form of 'Yes' or 'No'.\n",
    "6. following step 5 the key in the dictionary is scrambled with the help of a function defined called 'unsort'\n",
    "7. The function 'mean' is iterated which asks the user to enter the answer or choose to know the meaning of the scarambled word by entering a character '?'\n",
    "8. The user input is then checked for its validity and correctness, a seperate message is generated if the user guesses correctly and if the user guess the wrong word.\n",
    "9. Lastly, the user is asked to either continue with the program or to exit the program by asking a 'yes' or 'no' input.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ALGORITHM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import numpy library.\n",
    "2. Define a function called 'res' which tends to open the file in a read mode and splits the letter with ',' acting as a delimiter and stores the words in a dictionary.\n",
    "3. define a function called 'cal' which is used to calculate the euclidean distance by taking the input from the user.\n",
    "4. the function further compares the reviews of one reviewer with that of the other reviewers.\n",
    "5. The try block asks rthe user to input the file name and inherits both the functions and runs them in accordance to requiremnets of the user.\n",
    "6. The except block will handle the any exception regarding the file and thus pops out and error message.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Start the program by selecting the cell\n",
